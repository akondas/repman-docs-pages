# Packagist CDN/Proxy

The Repman Proxy can be used in two different ways: as a Composer plugin, or a composer.json file. Upon installation, the preferred mirror address to the Repman Proxy will be added for each package. Original addresses of repositories, distributions and sources will be kept.

## Composer plugin

Installation is very simple:

```bash
composer global require repman-io/composer-plugin
```

The command will install the plugin globally. From now on, all dependencies will be downloaded from the Repman Proxy using a global high-speed CDN.

## composer.json file

Another way is to use composer.json configuration file by adding these lines:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {"type": "composer", "url": "https://repo.repman.io"},
        {"packagist": false}
    ]
}
```

After that, you will need to update your composer.lock file to allow Composer to download dependencies from the Repman Proxy.

```bash
composer update --lock
```
