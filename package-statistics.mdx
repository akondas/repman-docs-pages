# Package statistics

Repman tracks the number of installations for each shared package. You can view global statistics for the entire organization by clicking "Package stats" on the organization's overview:

![Organization install](/docs/static/articles/package-statistics/organization-installs.png)

Additionally, you can check the stats for individual packages on the "Packages" view:

![Package installs](/docs/static/articles/package-statistics/package-installs.png)

Currently, the statistics are counted for all versions of the package. Statistics for individual versions will be available soon.
